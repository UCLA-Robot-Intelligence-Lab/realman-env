The following is the installation and use tutorial of the package.

## 1\. Build the environment
---
Before using the package, we first need to do the following operations.

* 1.[Install ROS2](#1.Install_ROS2)
* 2.[Install Moveit2](#Install_Moveit2)
* 3.[Configure the package environment](#Configure_the_package_environment)
* 4.[Compile](#Compile)

### 1.Install_ROS2

----

We provide the installation script for ROS2, `ros2_install.sh`, which is located in the `scripts` folder of the `ros2_rm_robot\dual_rm_install` package. In practice, we need to move to the path and execute the following commands.

```bash
sudo bash ros2_install.sh
```

If you do not want to use the script installation, you can also refer to the website [ROS2_INSTALL](https://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/Installation/Ubuntu-Install-Debians.html).

### Install_Moveit2

----

We provide the installation script for Moveit2, `moveit2_install.sh`, which is located in the `scripts` folder of the `ros2_rm_robot\dual_rm_install` package. In practice, we need to move to the path and execute the following commands.

```bash
sudo bash moveit2_install.sh
```

If you do not want to use the script installation, you can also refer to the website [Moveit2_INSTALL](https://moveit.ros.org/install-moveit2/binary/).

### Configure_the_package_environment

----

This script is located in the `lib` folder of the` ros2_rm_robot\dual_rm_driver` package. In practice, we need to move to the path and execute the following commands.

```bash
sudo bash lib_install.sh
```

----

Install chassis Ros2 interface installation package
Execute in the path of~/ros_2agv_robot/lib
```bash
sudo ./ros-foxy-woosh-robot-agent_0.0.1-0focal_arm64.run
```

### Compile

----

After the above execution is successful, execute the following commands to compile the package. First, we need to build a workspace and import the package file into the `src` folder under the workspace, and then use the `colcon build` command to compile.

```bash
mkdir -p ~/ros2_ws/src
cp -r rm_dual_arm_lifting_robot_ros2 ~/ros2_ws/src
cd ~/ros2_ws
colcon build --packages-select rm_ros_interfaces
colcon build --packages-select realsense2_camera_msgs
source ./install/setup.bash
colcon build
```

<img src="./pic/success.png" alt="pic" style="zoom:50%;" />

After the compilation is completed, the package can be run.

## 2\. Function running

---

Introduction to the package: The package includes example control of the dual-arm composite lifting robot in ROS2, allowing users to perform ROS2 operations on the dual-arm composite lifting robot. For ease of portability, each part of the dual-arm composite lifting robot is separately split into independent packages, facilitating the reuse and assembly of the packages.

**Note:** The lifting module for the dual-arm lifting is connected to the lifting mechanism of the left arm, and the head rotation is connected to the expansion joint of the right arm.

### 2.1  Demos for Various Components

#### 2.1.1 AGV Demo

#### 2.1.2 Camera Demo

The camera demo is located in the ros2_realsense2 folder, and the realsense2_camera camera node needs to be started first during the demo package (rm_camera_demo) test, and the command is as follows:

```bash
source ~/ros2_ws/install/setup.bash
ros2 launch realsense2_camera rs_launch.py 
```

Note: The original camera node start command is ros2 launch realsense2_camera rs_launch.py, if you need to use depth alignment RGB images, you need to add parameters to get the aligned image topic.

To start the demo visualizing D435 images, use the following command.

```bash
ros2 run rm_camera_demo sub_image_node
```

<img src="./pic/camera_demo.png" alt="pic" style="zoom:50%;" />

Start the demo to get the coordinate value of the center point of the image, and run the following command:

```bash
ros2 run rm_camera_demo Center_Coordinate_node
```

If you want to view the point cloud information of the camera, you can use the demo example provided with the camera driver package with the following command.

```bash
source ~/ros2_ws/install/setup.bash
ros2 launch realsense2_camera demo_pointcloud_launch.py
```

open the first rgb camera
```bash
source ~/ros2_ws/install/setup.bash
ros2 run rm_camera_demo camera_0_node 
```

Open the second rgb camera
```bash
source ~/ros2_ws/install/setup.bash
ros2 run rm_camera_demo camera_1_node 
```

Open the realsense depth camera, and the program will detect all realsense cameras. You can open the specified camera by selecting the device number
```bash
source ~/ros2_ws/install/setup.bash
ros2 run rm_camera_demo open_realsense_node 
```

#### 2.1.3 Voice Module Demo

#### 2.1.4 Overall Linkage Demo

1. Test Demo

start driver

```
source ~/ros2_ws/install/setup.bash
ros2 launch ros2_total_demo total_demo.launch.py
```

start demo node

```
source ~/ros2_ws/install/setup.bash
ros2 run ros2_total_demo total_demo_node
```

2.camera catch agv Demo(65b)（obj bottle）

start driver

```
source ~/ros2_ws/install/setup.bash
ros2 launch ros2_total_demo start_65_agv.launch.py
```

note：executing the camera node（ros2_total_demo/scripts detect_object.py）will print serial_number，please fill in the correct serial number in the code and compile it for execution

start the visual capture program(65b)（遨意灵巧手）

```
source ~/ros2_ws/install/setup.bash
ros2 run ros2_total_demo catch2object_65_aoyi_agv.py
```

or

start the visual capture program(65b)（两指夹爪）

```
source ~/ros2_ws/install/setup.bash
ros2 run ros2_total_demo catch2object_65_gripper_agv.py
```

**Note:** The Test Demo and Vision Grasping Demo cannot be started simultaneously. Select the script to execute based on the robot's end effector. For the chassis demo, you need to create a map for the chassis, add target points, initialize the position, and modify the target point ID in the code to match the ID value in the map. Compile and run the code afterward.

### Safety Tips

----

Please refer to the following operation specifications when using the robotic arm to ensure the user's safety.

* Check the installation of the robotic arm before each use, including whether the mounting screw is loose and whether the robotic arm is vibrating or trembling.
* During the running of the robotic arm, no person shall be in the falling or working range of the robotic arm, nor shall any other object be placed in the robot arm's safety range.
* Place the robotic arm in a safe location when not in use to avoid it from falling down and damaging or injuring other objects during vibration.
* Disconnect the robotic arm from the power supply in time when not in use.
