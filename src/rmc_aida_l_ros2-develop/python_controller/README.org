On very first install/boot of robot, fresh out of box. Must first run the installer for the woosh action server under ros2_ws/src/rmc_aida_l_ros2-develop/ros2_agv_robot/lib/ros-foxy-woosh-robot-agent_0.0.1-0focal_arm64.run.

Change to this directory and do:
sudo ./ros-foxy-woosh-robot-agent_0.0.1-0focal_arm64.run

Then restart for changes to take effect.

First run to start the action server:
ros2 run woosh_robot_agent agent --ros-args -r __ns:=/woosh_robot -p ip:="169.254.128.2"
- default ip is the 169 one. This will only work if you ahve installed the action server (*.run file) and restarted already.

Then:
cd ~/ros2_ws/
colcon build --packages-select python_controller
source install/setup.bash

Remember to source the setup.bash in any new terminal you make!

To build the package python_controller with the given nodes inside:
- keyboard_base_controller (control base movement with keyboard input)
- base_controller (example script to just go fowards some small distance)

Now can run with:
ros2 run python_controller keyboard_base_controller

To run the keyboard_base_controller node inside of the python_controller package.
